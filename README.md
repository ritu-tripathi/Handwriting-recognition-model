# Handwriting-recognition-model
This is a different kind of model. Here we are importing the dataset from MNIST. 
In this model we use a new library called fetch_openml , which retrieves the msnit datasets into our jupyter notebook.
In this model we are identifying an integer 2 as an example.
This model simply recognises the images from the mnist dataset. I have made this model under milestone 3 submission under my Lean In mentorship.
